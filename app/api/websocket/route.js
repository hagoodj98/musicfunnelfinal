//This message hits the API Gateway first, which routes the message based on the action field in the message payload. If no specific route matches (like for custom actions that I havenâ€™t explicitly set up as individual routes in the Gateway), the $default route is used which is this file. The $default route in API Gateway forwards this message to my backend endpoint (the default handler in my application). My backend, which receives this routed request, processes it based on the action. This could involve logging the heartbeat, updating database records, handling checkout processes, etc.
