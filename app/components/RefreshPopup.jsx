//This is the popup that appears when the timer is low. It tells the user, “Your session is about to run out! Do you want extra time?”. 

//It shows the current number of seconds left (thanks to the Timer passing that info through the SessionManager).

//It has a button like “Refresh Session” that, when clicked, calls an API (your backend endpoint) to refresh the session—kind of like getting extra time in the game.

//If the refresh is successful, it hides itself (by calling an onClose callback), and the new session time is set (or the page is reloaded so the new session takes effect).

//
//
//This popup only shows when SessionManager tells it to. But in order for SessionManager to do so, Timer has to do what SessionManager told it to do first.

const RefreshPopup = ({ timeLeft, onClose }) => {

    //So if you think about the popup itself, what do i want in it. Well, the remaining time left (60 seconds), a button to make the API call, a refresher (to let the user know the session is in process of refreshing the session), and it needs to hide when successful and the new session time is set The latter needs to get track of time that is left, and it needs the ability to close itself, so we need a timeLeft and onclose callback. Remember, the SessionManager is showing the popup. So the onclose is coming from SessionManager to RefreshPopup as a prop.
