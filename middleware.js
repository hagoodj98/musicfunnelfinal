This would help confirm that the session data being used is indeed the updated one. More importantly, it ensures the middleware is truly working with the updated session data—not just the session token name, but the new value (and new CSRF) that I expected. The reason why this is necessary is because i am using the same sessionToken name that the middleware is looking for. So to make sure the middleware is looking at the right sessionToken is by verifying the new csrf.

Imagine the session is like a secret club membership, and your CSRF token is like your secret handshake. When you first join the club, you get a certain handshake (the CSRF token) that’s stored on your membership card (the cookie) and in the club’s records (the session data in Redis).
        
Now, if for extra security the club decides to change the handshake (rotate the tokens), they give you a new secret handshake and update your membership record. Your membership card (the cookie) is also updated with the new handshake.
        
When you go to the club gate (which is like the middleware), the guard asks you for your secret handshake. The guard then checks the membership record to see what the current, new handshake should be. If what you show (csrfFromCookie) matches the new handshake in the record (sessionData.csrf), you’re allowed in. If not, then something is wrong and you’re not allowed in.
